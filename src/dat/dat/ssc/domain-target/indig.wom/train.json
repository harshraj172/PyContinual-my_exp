That is not gangsta. Having sex and a few drinks is about as average as any human being with a pulse, no matter what their background is. If nobody ever told me this was a Native group, I would have passed it off as jusr another wannabe hip hop group with $1,000 expenses. Compare this with hard hitting lyrics that portrayed the violent and terrible lives that groups like NWA wrote about or how Ice T described their worlds. Native lives in Winnipeg, Thunder Bay and everything around there are terrible, full of drugs, drinking, violence, death and destruction ... there is nothing to glorify here. Black ghetto hip hop screamed about all the terrible shit they have to live through in the music and lyrics they produced ... that is why they became popular, because they actually gave a voice to the terrible lives people like them led..not like you pathetic fire hollaring freaks."}, "17": {"id": 24694, "polarity": "-1", "sentence": "\"Melbourne orgasms\"?.
