Their format was all about the 'party' and the staged show that was put on. Very burlesque / studio 54. Two of the four co-owners curated/styled the parties and also did a live sex show. There was a film about it all but you will not find any traces of it now for love or money. I suspect Mike and Claire (who did the live sex shows) have wiped all internet traces of it as they now have children. The film was sold on video so someone somewhere will have it. Lots of famous people partied there and then at the former brothel which became the manumission hotel - jade jagger, kate moss, all sorts.
