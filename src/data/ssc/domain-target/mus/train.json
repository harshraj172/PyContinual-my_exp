Swine-lamic Goblins are Invading Europe Illegally by the Thousands each & Every Month. They spit on Western Civilization & every Decent White Value it Stands for. Their goal in Europe is to Outbreed Everyone else. The average Euro Taxpayer Complains he or she can't Afford to have Children, yet they still Think Nothing of Paying the Heavy Socialist Taxes that give the Anything-but-peaceful Swine-lamics a free ride on the Welfare Train, again. The Swine-lamic Pedophile Mullah Preachers in Europe are Preaching this Delusional, White hate. The Public Schools & Private are Teaching White self Hate & the Delusional. The State-Controlled Media Outlets are Spewing this Delusional, White Hate . The Maniacal Dictators are Enforcing the same Delusional, White hate..
